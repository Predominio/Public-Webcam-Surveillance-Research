# Public Webcam Surveillance Research Archive  
*Verified active public camera networks (as of 2025-09-03)*  

## Historical Context  
Public webcam infrastructure has operated globally since the 1990s for:  
- Traffic management (`NY Thruway`, `Biste State Gatecams`)  
- Tourism promotion (`EarthCam`, `Skyline Webcams`)  
- Environmental monitoring (`Monterey Bay Aquarium`)  
- Urban planning (`Grote Markt Groningen`)  

> **Note**: These are *legitimately operated public feeds*, distinct from unauthorized surveillance. The existence of these networks predates modern "surveillance panic" by decades.

## Research Implications  
1. **Historical Precedent**: Public camera networks predate social media by 15+ years (e.g., [Trojan Room Coffee Pot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trojan_Room_coffee_pot), 1991-2001)  
2. **Transparency vs. Privacy**: Legitimate public feeds ≠ covert surveillance  
3. **Policy Gap**: Most jurisdictions regulate *data usage* (GDPR, CCPA), not camera existence  

> **Recommendation**: Research should focus on *governance frameworks* rather than camera proliferation myths.
